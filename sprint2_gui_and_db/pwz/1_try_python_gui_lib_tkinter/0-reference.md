>[The Better Way Forward](http://tkdocs.com/tutorial/onepage.html)

>Tk gives you a lot of choices. There are at least six different ways to layout widgets on the screen. Multiple widgets can be used to accomplish the same thing, and that's before considering any Tk extensions. Tk emphasized backward compatibility, which is a double-edged sword. Most of these old ways of doing things still keep working, year after year. That doesn't mean you should keep using some of them.

>**So there are many in Tk, but frankly, all that choice gets in the way. If you want to learn and use Tk, you don't need to know ten different ways to accomplish the same thing. You shouldn't need to do all the research, explore all the options, and make a choice yourself. You need to know the right way to do things today. That's what this tutorial will give you. Think of it as the documentation equivalent of opinionated software.**

>So we'll often use different ways of doing things than you'd find in other documentation or examples. Usually, it's because when those were written, the better ways didn't even exist yet. (Here's a litmus test for Tk documentation: does it use the archaic pack instead of the modern grid?) Later on, once you're an expert and encounter some wacky situation where the typical choice doesn't fit, you can go hunt around for alternatives.
